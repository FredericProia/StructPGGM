# StructPGGM
Adjust a partial Gaussian graphical model (PGGM) with structural penalty following the frequentist approach of Okome Obiang et al. (2021). The Gibbs samplers for sparse, group-sparse and sparse-group-sparse direct links are provided in "GibbsPGGM.R". An example on simulated data is given in "Example.R". The real dataset Hopx (cf. Petretto et al. (2010)) is also given with a demonstration in "ExampleHopx.R".
